 In this session the RISC-HDP cohort was introduced to the chipcron tool developed by the trainer of the course Mayank Kabra
 This tool is a an automatic RISCV core generator tool which spits out synthesizable RTL for a RISC core based on the specification provided by the user Core's specification 
 depends on the application for which the RISCV core needs to be created. The tool also generates a verilog testbench to test the core 
 This session's task for each member of the cohort is to identify an IoT application for which they would like to generate a RISC core using the ChipCron tool
