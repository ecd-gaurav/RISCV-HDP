### Tasks done this week- 

1. Simulation of the motion_sensitive_led_bar specific RISC-V design without UART loading the memory
  
2. Debugged the program as it was not giving desired results in simulation 

3. Optimized the C program and inline assembly program to give desired results

4. Created the processor core again based on the optimized C application program to achieve quickest input to output transition

5. Updated the testbench to add more stimulus points , and observed the waveform

6. Analysed the waveform and inputs and outputs of varuious black box modules like ID pipeline , ALU etc
