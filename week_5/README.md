In this week we create a Custom RISC-V core that will run our application bare metal program that was created last week using inline assembly code.

Before creating the RISC-V core , We spend some time understanding the final assmebly code generated by the RISC-V assembler. We understand how the integer variables are stored on stack and how the stack pointter progresses.
