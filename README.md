# RISCV-HDP

This Repository contains various course assignments completed by me during my participation in the Product Based 6 Week long RISC-V Skilling Program offered by www.vlsisystemdesign.com

Each Week_# folder contains the learnings and assignments done during that week of RISCV-HDP training.

Training Duration : 03/04/2024 to 04/12/2024

Update : 
Successfully Completed the program. This program covered all layers of the stack, ranging from application code to Netlist, providing a holistic understanding of designing RISC-V-based embedded projects. As part of the course curriculum, I had the opportunity to design a custom RISC-V core using the Chipcron tool provided by RISC-V startup https://chipcron-pvt-ltd.github.io/webpage/ Additionally, I gained practical experience by simulating application code on the designed core, further enhancing my knowledge in RISC-V architecture and design methodologies.
